## üó£Ô∏è Audio & Video Communication

### üé§¬†Speech & Audio

- A native or near-native **accent in English is welcome** as we celebrate global diversity but it the speech must be extremely **clear and pleasant** to listen to (no ‚Äúhard‚Äù or ‚Äústrong‚Äù accents are ok)
    - References:
        - Positive: Arnold Schwarzenegger‚Äôs accent - clearly foreign accent but easy to understand
        - Negative: Conor McGregor‚Äôs accent - too strong and too hard to understand
- **Excellence sound quality**
- In recorded videos or podcasts: **thoughtful use of music**

Extra notes:

- At the beginning of the calls, pleasure ensure that the sound quality is good and ask to notify you if the quality falls below a very pleasant comfortable level

- RadioLab podcast
- Headspace app

### üé•¬†Video Calls & Recordings

**üì∏¬†Lighting & Camera**

- **Natural lighting** is strongly preferred
    - Best setup is often being near a window with non-direct sunlight falling on your face
- Face must be well-lit (sunlight falling on your face is ideal)
- Use a high-quality camera
    - For day-to-day video calls modern MacBook camera is often enough
- Maintain professional framing:
    - Face centered
    - Normal angle (not looking down or up)
    - Looking into the camera
        - On your computer you can decrease the window with the video of the person you are speaking to and put it near the center-top, so that it is near your computer camera. This way it will feel more natural as you are looking them in the eyes, rather than looking lower than them or to the side of them.

**üñºÔ∏è¬†Video Calls Background**

Please thoughtfully setup one or more physical spaces for video calls:

- We strongly encourage using a real well-prepared physical space as a background
- It‚Äôs good when your background can naturally highlights your values or interests
- You can use a unique intentional image background as a backup in rare cases where you are not in your prepared space
- We strongly discourage blurring your physical space
- We strongly discourage using popular Zoom backgrounds

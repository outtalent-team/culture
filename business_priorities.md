# Business Priorities

When making the most important decisions for our business, we aim to follow these priorities for our business:

1. Excellence
We want to provide [excellent](https://github.com/outtalent-team/culture/blob/main/excellence_aspirations.md) services in everything we do.

2. Longevity
We want the business to survive and thrive for the longest possible time, way beyond our lifetimes.

3. Scale
We want to help people from all countries and gather an amazing truly global community.

4. Speed
We want to move as "move as fast as healthily possible" to see more fruits of our labor during our lifetimes.

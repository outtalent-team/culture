# Business Priorities

When making the most important decisions for our business, we aim to follow these priorities:

## 1. Excellence

We aim to provide [**excellent**](https://github.com/outtalent-team/culture/blob/main/excellence_aspirations.md) services in everything we do — from product quality to how we communicate and make decisions.

## 2. Longevity

We want the business to **survive and thrive for the longest possible time**, continuing to grow and create value well beyond our lifetimes.

## 3. Scale

We want to **help people from all countries** and build an **amazing, truly global community** where talent and opportunities connect without borders.

## 4. Speed

We want to **move as fast as healthily possible** — balancing velocity with sustainability — so we can see more of the fruits of our labor during our lifetimes.

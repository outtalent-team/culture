[DRAFT]

In our team we want to only work with people who deeply value and aspire to the following.

# 1. Truthfulness

We want to operate in the world based on truth rather than what is more comfortable to believe.
We do our best to get to the truth and accept it even if it's very painful and costly.

When asked a question by our ally, we commit to only communicating truth even if it's difficult for any of us.

We don't like it when people lie to themselves, to their allies, or the world in general.

# 2. Responsibility

We believe we can significantly affect the world and our life in particular.

When something bad happens, we analyze the situation to understand what our impact was.
In unclear situations, we default to accepting responsibility rather than running away from it.

In social situations, we announce our responsibility and apologize.
We don't come up with excuses by starting explaining why we failed when no one was asking.

We try never to "complain" by not telling other people what we don't like about life when no one was asking.
If we don't like something and it could be changed, we go and change it.
If it can't be changed, we don't complain about it, we make peace with it.

# 3. Excellence

We care how we impact the world in everything we do and want to make sure the result feels perfect at least for us.
When we do not achieve excellence, we analyze and improve our processes.

# 4. Thoughtfulness

We love to analyze ourselves and understand ourselves better.
This helps us understand other people better too.

We always analyze and correct our thinking processes to minimize irrationalities or other mistakes.

We love to think long-term, plan, and iterate on our plans.
We love to set goals and design everything very intentionally.

We aim not to overthink and use rigorous thinking to make decisions quickly.

# 5. Kindness

We love being humans and we love humans in general.
We accept human imperfections.

While we try never to make mistakes, we will inevitably make them sometimes.
We don't attack or punish ourselves for mistakes. We can laugh about our mistakes.
Then we analyze them and keep improving our processes.

When we need to communicate truth that is hurtful for the person we will try to do it in a kind way.
Sometimes that could mean delaying the answer intentionally.

# 6. Ambition

We would like to live the best lives possible and affect the world in the biggest way possible.
We like people who are energized and motivated to keep learning, improving, and creating as much as possible.

# 7. Innovation

We always try to keep learning, improving, and innovating.
We never want to stagnate and do the same thing the same way over and over again just because it's comfortable.

# 8. Fun

We don't like to always be serious. We don't like to be boring.
Where it makes sense, we try to make the world and our own experience more delightful, creative, playful, and fun.

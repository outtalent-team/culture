[DRAFT]

In our team we want to only work with people who deeply value and aspire to the following.

# 1. Responsibility

We believe we can significantly affect the world and our life in particular.

When something bad happens, we analyze the situation to understand what our impact was.
In unclear situations, we default to taking more responsibility for the bad outcome.

In social situations, we announce our responsibility and apologize.
We don't start explaining why we failed if noone is asking.

We also don't tell other people what we don't like about life if noone asked us.
If we don't like something and it could be changed, we go and change it.
If it can't be changed, we don't complain about, we make peace with it.

# 2. Excellence

We want to always achieve excellence in everything we do.
We love pleasant design in everything. We avoid making typos.

If we did not achieve excellence, we analyze and improve our processes.

We hate people that make a ton of typos and put little care in how they affect the world and people around the world.

# 3. Thoughtfulness

We love to analyze ourselves.
We often work with world-class psychotherapists to understand ourselves better.
This helps us understand other people better too.

We always analyze and correct our thinking processes to minimize irrationalities or other mistakes.

We love to think maximally long-term, plan, and iterate on our plans.
We love to set goals and design everything very intentionally.

# 4. Kindness

We love being humans and we love humans in general.
We accept human imperfections.

While we try never to make typos or other mistakes, we will inevitably make them sometimes.
We don't attack or punish ourselves for mistakes. We can laugh about our mistakes.
Then we analyze them and keep improving our processes.

# 5. Ambition

We would like to live the best lives possible and affect the world in the biggest way possible.
We don't like settling for small goals.

# 6. Fun

We don't like to always be serious.
We think it's too boring.

We like to make the world and our own experience delightful and fun.
